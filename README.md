### Wasm Full Text Search

ü¶Ä + üï∏ = ‚ù§Ô∏è

The Full Text Search in WebAssembly is aiming for minimizing bundle size and heavy computation on the client side. Make sure Cargo and the following tools are installed.

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

[`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/introduction.html)

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack
```

[`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen)

```bash
brew install binaryen
```

[Twiggy](https://rustwasm.github.io/twiggy/index.html)

```bash
cargo install twiggy
```

### Building `wasm/fulltext-search`

At the project root, run

```bash
# execute script with Cargo
cargo run scripts/fulltext-search

# or npm
yarn fulltext-search
```

It will generate the WebAssembly and JavaScript glue code in `wasm/fulltext-search/pkg`.

To lint the script, run

```bash
cargo clippy
```

More information about Clippy, please check out [its repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).
