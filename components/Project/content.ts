      "Reading turned my life around, and I believe it can turn yours too. There're so many books full of wisdom but it's hard to find yourself a book among the overwhelming options. So I'm giving away a book every month to a subscriber and help you find your next book to read. Sign up! Hopefully you'll be inspired too:)",
