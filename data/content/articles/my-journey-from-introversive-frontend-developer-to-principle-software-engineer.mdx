My journey is a bit of a bumpy one and full of learnings.
I'm so grateful for the experience and the people that help me along the way.

I recently joined a European public company as Lead Software Engineer.
The role is part of the leadership model in the company with a responsibility of Principle Software Engineer and Senior Engineering Manager.
It's as challenging as it sounds to move from being an individual contributor to having a duo responsibility.
I want to share with you how I got here and all the resources that have a tremendous impact on my road to tech leadership.

If you're interested in Unicode in Rust and JavaScript, I wrote an article ["Indexing Strings in Rust and TypeScript: A Case Study of String"](/articles/indexing-strings-in-rust-and-typescript).
There we discussed how Rust and JavaScript handle strings with a classic algorithm.
