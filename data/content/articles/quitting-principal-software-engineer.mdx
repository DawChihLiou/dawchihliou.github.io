## TL;DR

---

Operating as a principal software engineer

## Is It A Right Project?

Usually you're one of the first tech representatives in the company to hear about a project, and you need to make an internal dialog to either pursue or discard.

You'll hear about the project in different maturities depending on how your company normally generates business ideas. It could range from a observation of a potential user need to "we need it in three months".
Regardless, you'll have to make a call and discuss with the other leads. A simplified train of thought looks like this:

- Do or don't do?
- If "do", is it the right timing?
- What's the engineering complexity?
- How's the effort, time-wise?
- Do we have the resources?
- Do or don't do? 😵‍💫

There are many factors. What I'm suggesting is simply:

> Follow your gut😎

Usually you'll have an intuition, an excitement or an energetic feeling, to say yes to the project. To develop the intuition over time, there are a few exercises I find very useful to formulate my engineering opinion:

- Learn your industry and the competitive landscape.
- Learn your company's strategy. (If you're like me not really knowing what "strategy" means in the business world, I highly recommend the book "[Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586928-playing-to-win)" by A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin.)
- Align the project with company's [OKR](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)s.
- Talk to the designers about the user needs and pain points in their research.
- Talk to the project managers(PM) or product owners(PO) about the market research.
- Visualize your company's project portfolio. Just by looking at the visualizations, you'll get a better sense of the balance between short term and long term commitments, team/project allocation, and buffer for adaption.

## What Does Success Look Like?

Visualizing what success looks like early on helps you in many ways:

- Solidify your gut feeling about the project.
- Communicate the goal and alignment with OKRs more clearly.
- Design KPIs to measure the progress and impact.

Here you have it! Thanks for reading through🙌

If you find it useful, please share this article to help more people in their engineering journey.

Feel free to connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dawchihliou)!

In my previous article ["From Frontend Developer to Principal Software Engineer"](/articles/from-frontend-developer-to-principal-software-engineer), I shared 50+ books and online resources that helped me in my engineering journey.

If you're interested in implementing Binary Trees in Rust, my previous article ["Binary Tree Insertion in Rust"](/articles/binary-tree-insertion-in-rust) shared my struggle when I was implementing a Binary Tree.
It took me some time to have a grasp on Rust's ownership.

If you're interested in Unicode in Rust and JavaScript, I wrote an article ["Indexing Strings in Rust and TypeScript: A Case Study of String"](/articles/indexing-strings-in-rust-and-typescript).
There we discussed how Rust and JavaScript handle strings with a classic algorithm.

Happy coding!
