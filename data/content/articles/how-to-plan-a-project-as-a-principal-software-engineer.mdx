## TL;DR

- ðŸ‘‘ Shipping is queen.
- ðŸ”­ Visualize and define success early on.
- ðŸ¤¹ Don't forget to include performance monitoring and KPI analysis.
- ðŸŽ¯ Principal engineer is a leadership role. Think about your involvement in the project.

Usually you're one of the first technical representatives in the organization to hear about a project as a principal engineer, and you need to make an internal dialog on either pursue or discard it. There are many things to consider in terms of time budget, resources, stakeholder communication, and even your own involvement when it comes to planning.

So I want to share with you how I think about planning as a principal engineer and what are the important questions to ask in the planning phase of the project.

## Is It The Right Project?

You'll hear about the project in different maturities depending on how your organization normally generates business ideas. It could range from a observation of a potential user need to "we need it in three months". Regardless, a simplified train of thought looks like this:

- Do or don't do?
- If "do", is it the right timing?
- What's the engineering complexity?
- How's the effort?
- Do we have the resources?
- Do or don't do?

There are many more factors. What I'm suggesting is simply:

> Follow your gutðŸ˜Ž

Usually you'll have an intuition, an excitement or an energetic feeling, to say yes to the project. To develop the intuition over time, there are a few exercises I find very useful to formulate my engineering opinion:

- Learn your industry and the competitive landscape.
- Learn your organization's strategy. (If you're like me not really knowing what "strategy" means in the business world, I highly recommend the book "[Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586928-playing-to-win)" by A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin.)
- Align the project with organization's [OKR](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)s.
- Talk to the designers about the user needs and pain points in their research.
- Talk to the project managers(PM) or product owners(PO) about the market research.
- Visualize your organization's project portfolio. Just by looking at it, you'll get a better sense of the balance between short term and long term commitments, team/project allocation, and buffer for adaption.

If you are not sure about how to prioritize it, you can work on a [Prioritization Matrix](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-matrices/) with your team to figure out where the project stands. A Prioritization Matrix looks like this:

<img
  src="/optimized/articles/plan-as-principal-swe/prioritization-matrix.webp"
  alt="Prioritization matrix"
  width="100%"

/>

Note that **Voting based on expertise** is critical in the process because it will reveal how people in different disciplines think about the importance and urgency of the projects. It's a invisible third axis of the matrix.

## What Does Success Look Like?

Visualizing what success looks like early on helps you in many ways:

- Solidify your gut feeling about the project.
- Communicate the goal and alignment with OKRs to others more clearly.
- Design KPIs to measure the progress and impact.

I like to use [Amazon's "Working Backwards" approach](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister) to put my thoughts in a **press release**. It is a great way to put people in the same frame of mind just by "seeing" what happens after the finish line.

I use the press release as the starting point to invite conversations and consolidate the references to the documentations. Usually includes:

- Project epics or overview.
- UI Design mockups.
- Engineering system designs.
- KPI analytics.

## How to Ship It ASAP?

> "Ship to learn."

It became my guiding principle ever since I read about this quote. [GitHub](https://dev.to/mscccc/how-we-use-ship-small-to-rapidly-build-new-features-at-github-5cl9) shares the same idea in their leadership principles and I think the mindset is the foundation of lean and agile software development because it's:

- human-centered and user-focused.
- powered by iterations of feedback and learning.
- measurable.

I like to use [Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) as a framework to think about the problems and how to iterate through out the project. Combining with the press release and KPIs, it's a great way to validate your assumptions and stay in the course.

[Design Sprint](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) is another great tool to crack a problem and kick start the exploration. Most importantly, it's funðŸ¤©

When you're facing a complex project, make sure your system design proposals include alternatives that are simpler and quicker to build. It'll allow the teams to iterate faster.

The takeaway here is to really focus on **delivering the project to the users' hands**, instead of implementing a complete solution.

## What about KPI Analysis?

It's very useful to look at business KPIs and UX KPIs side by side to get a better sense of the data. It's important to dive into the analysis with PMs and designers to find out the direction of the next iteration.

There are a few basic concepts in statistic I learned that are useful to collaborate with Business Intelligence and Design teams.

- [Permutation Testing](https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/)
- [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value)
- [A/B Testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/)
- [A/B/n Testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/abn-testing/)
- [Multivariate testing](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/multivariate-testing/)
- [Multi-armed bandit](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/multi-armed-bandit/)
- [When To Do Multivariate Tests Instead of A/B/n Tests](https://cxl.com/blog/multivariate-tests/)
- [The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem and Its Solutions](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-01-23-multi-armed-bandit/)

## Is Performance Monitoring in Place?

Technical performance is another opportunity to inject engineering context into discussions for the next iterations.

In general, there are [two types of monitoring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic):

- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Synthetic Monitoring

RUM is about live data. It tells a story of real user behavior and how your system performs over time. Synthetic monitoring reports data of your system in a controlled environment so it's suitable for [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis), [regressions testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing), and [performance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing).

Here are some useful tools for monitoring:

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com)
- [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- [autocannon - GitHub](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon)
- [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io)
- [K6 - GitHub](https://github.com/grafana/k6)
- [Performance API - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API)
- [Clinic.js](https://clinicjs.org)

## Should I code as A Principal Software Engineer?

I believe you should, but the bottom line is to empower engineers and make sure your involvement doesn't block or interfere the iterations.

Many principal engineers have [different opinions and experiences](https://staffeng.com/guides/what-do-staff-engineers-actually-do) but I truly believe that if [coding is your craft](https://dawchihliou.github.io/articles/from-frontend-developer-to-principal-software-engineer#staying-true-to-craft) and you love it, you should code. The question is more about **when and where** you should be coding.

My [leadership coach](https://www.keyplay-consulting.com) introduced a model to me called [Situational Leadership](https://asana.com/resources/situational-leadership). I use it to think about my involvement in projects. It looks like this:

<img
  src="/optimized/articles/plan-as-principal-swe/situational-leadership.webp"
  alt="Situational leadership"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

The model suggests that there are 4 types of leadership styles and you can fluidly choose the styles to lead based on the situations.

For situations of supporting and coaching, I think the best place and time to code are:

- Prototyping.
- Hackathon.
- Tooling for developer experience.
- Data Visualization.

Your intention is to maintain a certain level of involvement and visibility to the projects to provide support when needed. They are usually important projects with a longer time frame. They are also the type of projects that you spend time on mentoring and sponsoring engineers.

For situations of directing, I think it's better not to code because you're highly invested in the direction of the project. You'll be doing a lot of analyses and communications. Hands-on work often distract you from your focus.

## Final Thoughts

We touched on the questions I find useful to planning:

- Is it the right project?
- What does success look like?
- How to ship it ASAP?
- What about KPI analysis?
- Is performance monitoring in place?
- Should I code as a principal software engineer?

It's important to know that there's no specific order to these questions. You can think about them in different sequence depending on your situation.

<img
  src="/optimized/articles/plan-as-principal-swe/flow.webp"
  alt="Situational leadership"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

What's important is that at the end of the planning, you have a clear idea how to iterate through your assumptions and bring the project live to the users.
