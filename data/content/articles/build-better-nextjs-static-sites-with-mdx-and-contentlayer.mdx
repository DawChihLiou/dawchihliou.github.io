## TL;DR

- 💨 Contentlayer reduces a lot of friction in publishing the content on my static website.
- 😍 MDX with remark and rehype plugins is awesomely convenient and powerful.
- 🍵 Next.js jells very well with Contentlayer and MDX

I fully embraced [Static Site Generation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one) (SSG) for my website to optimize the site speed and scaling in the future.

Recently I've been researching on reducing the effort to create a new article on my website.
There were many touch points in my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project setup in order to:

- publish a new article
- estimate reading time
- update [the list of articles](/articles)
- create a new RSS feed
- update sitemap

## What Was The Problem?

I analyzed a little more and found out the friction was in my MDX usage.
My file structure looked like this:

```bash
my-blog
├── public
├── data
│   └── blogs.json
├── components
│   └── Blog.tsx
└── pages
    ├── blogs
    │   ├── blog-one.mdx
    │   ├── blog-two.mdx
    │   └── blog-three.mdx
    └── index.tsx
```

It is the [standard setup](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) recommended by Next.js.
I was using [@mdx-js/loader](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/tree/main/packages/loader) and [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx) to transform MDX into pages.

Take `pages/blogs/blog-one.mdx` for example, the content looked like this:

```jsx:pages/blogs/blog-one.mdx
import Blog from '../../components/Blog'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Blog One🚀',
  publishedAt: 'February 4, 2022'
  description: "Learn how to build a Next.js blog with MDX and Contentlayer!",
  cover: '/optimized/articles/blog-one/hero.webp',
}

export default ({ children }) => (
  <Blog
    title={meta.title}
    description={meta.description}
    cover={meta.cover}
    publishedAt={meta.publishedAt}
  >
    {children}
  </Blog>
)

Hey There👋

Welcome to Blog one✨ Let's learn together!
```

`blog-one.mdx` named-exported a meta data.
It was picked up by the the default component that took care of the layout and rendered the meta data.

The `<Blog />` component looked like this:

```tsx:components/Blog.tsx
import { BlogProps } from './types'

export default function Blog(props: BlogProps) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <h2>{props.description}</h2>
      <p>
        {props.publishedAt}
      </p>
      <img alt={props.title} src={props.cover} width="100%" loading="lazy" />
      {props.children}
    </article>
  )
}
```

I was treating MDX files as pages.

Because the `meta` data in each MDX file was trapped in the page, I duplicated all the meta data and aggregated them in `data/blogs.json`.
I used it to maintain the list of articles on my website, the RSS feed, and the [sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/overview) for SEO.

> It would be much better if I could treat the MDX files as data, and generate pages based on the data.

This way, **I could use the MDX files as data points and page content at the same time**.
Publishing a new article ideally could be much more frictionless.

I came across [Lee Robinson's website](https://leerob.io/) and found out he was using a alpha library called [Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) to solve the problem.

## What is Contentlayer

[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) is an library in its early stage that turns content into data.
It works roughly like this:

- It takes in headless CMS or local content in YAML, JSON, MDX, or Markdown as source.
- It transforms the content into TypeScript types and data files in JSON that includes the original content, meta data, and any derived data we specified.
- It aggregates all the data in JSON and exports them as [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules).

For my use case, I can use the aggregated data generated by Contentlayer to replace my previous manual process:

- I use the generated data to build the new page for an article.
- I use the generated data to render [the list of articles](https://dawchihliou.github.io/articles).
- I use the generated data to create a new RSS feed.
- I use the new file structure to generate a new sitemap.
- All automatic!

Contentlayer offers easy integration with Next.js.
I'll show you how in the next sections.

## Using MDX as Data

Let's first explore how to use MDX as a data point.

MDX offers [YAML frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) support with custom parsers.
You can express the meta data like this:

```md:data/blogs/blog-one.mdx
---
title: 'Blog One🚀'
publishedAt: 'February 4, 2022'
description: 'Learn how to build a Next.js blog with MDX and Contentlayer!'
cover: '/optimized/articles/blog-one/hero.webp'
---

Hey There👋

Welcome to Blog One✨ Let's learn together!
```

You can see the meta data in YAML syntax is inside the `---` block, and the body of the content follows in MDX syntax.
Comparing to the [old setup](#what-was-the-problem) where MDX file were treated as pages, the new MDX file contains only meta data and content.

The next thing we need to do is to generate the blog page that renders the meta data and the content with the layout from `<Blog />` component.

## Integrating Contentlayer in Next.js

Now that we updated the MDX files to contain only data and content, Let's move them into the `data` directory.

The new file structure looks like this:

```bash
my-blog
├── public
├── components
│   └── Blog.tsx
├── pages
│   ├── blogs
│   │   └── [slug].tsx
│   └── index.tsx
└── data
    └──blogs
       ├── blog-one.mdx
       ├── blog-two.mdx
       └── blog-three.mdx
```

Notice that we replaced the MDX files in `pages/blogs` directory with a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) `[slug].tsx`.
We'll use this page to statically generate the blog pages [later](#using-contentlayer-data-for-static-site-generation).

### Configuring Contentlayer

Contentlayer offers seamless integration with Next.js.

To install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn add contentlayer next-contentlayer
```

Contentlayer reads the configuration from `contentlayer.config.ts`.
Let's create one.

```bash
touch contentlayer.config.ts
```

Inside the `contentlayer.config.ts`, we need to add instructions to tell Contentlayer how to parse:

- `name`: namespace
- `filePathPattern`: input files
- `bodyType`: content body type for parsing
- `fields`: meta data fields
- `computedFields`: derived meta data fields

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'
import readingTime from 'reading-time'

export const Blog = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Blog',
  filePathPattern: 'blogs/*.mdx',
  bodyType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    publishedAt: { type: 'string', required: true },
    description: { type: 'string', required: true },
    cover: { type: 'string', required: true },
  },
  computedFields: {
    readingTime: {
      type: 'json',
      resolve: (doc) => readingTime(doc.body.raw)
    },
    slug: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.sourceFileName.replace('.mdx', ''),
    },
  },
}))

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'data',
  documentTypes: [Blog],
  mdx: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
})
```

In the `computedFields`, we can compute data like `readingTime` from the content body🤩.
I'm using [`reading-time`](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time) for calculating the reading time based on word count.
The `slug` field is for generating the dynamic route later in the `[slug].tsx` page.

Under the hood, Contentlayer uses [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to parse MDX and YAML frontmatter and extract the content and data.
If you're interested in the magic behind it, you can read more about [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and [`remark-mdx-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter).
These are the libraries `mdx-bundler` uses internally.

At the end of the configuration, `makeSource` will then look for files that match `blogs/*.mdx` pattern under `data` directory and generate the blog data in `.contentlayer` directory at your project root.

Lastly, wrap your Next.js configuration with `next-contentlayer` to integrate with Next.js's live-reload and build process.

```js:next.config.js
const { withContentlayer } = require('next-contentlayer')

module.exports = withContentlayer()({
  // ... your Next.js config
})
```

### Using Contentlayer data for Static Site Generation

We are ready to use the generated data from Contentlayer and build the static pages🤩

All we need to do is to use `allBlogs` from `.contentlayer/data` to build the dynamic routes with [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths) and use [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props) to pass the blog data to the `[slug].tsx` page.

```tsx:pages/blogs/[slug].tsx
import { useMDXComponent } from 'next-contentlayer/hooks'
import { allBlogs } from '.contentlayer/data'
import type { Blog } from '.contentlayer/types'
import BlogLayout from '../../../components/Blog'

type BlogProps = {
  blog: Blog
}

export default function Blog({ blog }: BlogProps) {
  const Component = useMDXComponent(post.body.code)

  return (
    <BlogLayout {...blog}>
      <Component />
    </BlogLayout>
  )
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: allBlogs.map((blog) => ({ params: { slug: blog.slug } })),
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const blog = allBlogs.find((blog) => blog.slug === params.slug)
  return { props: { blog } }
}
```

After the project is built, you'll see the blogs available at `/blogs/blog-one`, `/blogs/blog-two`, and `/blogs/blog-three`✨

### Bonus: remark & rehype Plugins

There are a lot more we can do with MDX by leveraging remark and rehype plugins in the `contentlayer.config.ts`.

- [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) is an awesome plugin ecosystem that transforms markdown.
- [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) is another powerful plugin ecosystem that transforms HTML.

They are two separate ecosystems but we can convert remark to rehype and generate HTML markup.
The transformation looks like this:

```bash
MDX ----> remark AST ------> rehype AST --------> HTML
    parse            convert            stringify
```

Contentlayer takes care of the flow.
All we need to do is adding the plugins to provide instruction for the transformations.
I'm using the following plugins:

- [`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) to support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- [`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) and [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) to render heading links.
- [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus) to render syntax highlighting in code blocks.
- [`rehype-code-titles`](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/rehype-code-titles) to render code block titles.
- [`rehype-accessible-emojis`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-accessible-emojis) to provide accessibility to emojis.

```diff:contentlayer.config.ts
+ import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
+ import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug'
+ import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings'
+ import rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles'
+ import rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus'
+ import { rehypeAccessibleEmojis } from 'rehype-accessible-emojis'

// ...

export default makeSource({
  mdx: {
-    remarkPlugins: [],
+    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
-    rehypePlugins: [],
+    rehypePlugins: [
+      rehypeSlug,
+      rehypeCodeTitles,
+      rehypePrism,
+      rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
+      rehypeAccessibleEmojis,
    ],
  },
})
```

## Contentlayer Applications

There are more things we can do with the data.

### Application #1: RSS Feed

I can now write a script to generate a RSS feed base on the `allBlogs` data!

```js:scripts/rss.mjs
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs'
import RSS from 'rss'
import { allBlogs } from '.contentlayer/data'

const feed = new RSS({
  title: "My Blogs",
  feed_url: 'localhost:3000/rss.xml',
  site_url: 'localhost:3000',
})

allBlogs.map((blog) => ({
  title: blog.title,
  description: blog.description,
  url: `localhost:3000/blogs/${blog.slug}`
  date: blog.publishedAt,
})).forEach((item) => {
  feed.item(item)
})

writeFileSync('./public/rss.xml', feed.xml({ indent: true }))
```

### Application #2: XML Sitemap

It's easier to write a script for sitemap generation.
All we need is the file structure in the `data` and `page` directories.

```js:scripts/sitemap.mjs
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs'
import { globby } from 'globby'
import prettier from 'prettier'

const pages = await globby([
  'pages/*.tsx',
  'data/**/*.mdx',
  '!pages/_*.tsx',
])

const urlTags = pages
  .map((file) =>
    file
      .replace('pages', '')
      .replace('data/content', '')
      .replace('.tsx', '')
      .replace('.mdx', '')
  )
  .map((path) => (path === '/index' ? '/' : path))
  .map(
    (path) => `
      <url>
          <loc>localhost:3000${path}</loc>
      </url>
    `
  )
  .join('')

const sitemap = `
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
      ${urlTags}
  </urlset>
`

const prettierConfig = await prettier.resolveConfig('./prettierrc')
const formatted = prettier.format(sitemap, {
  ...prettierConfig,
  parser: 'html',
})

writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', formatted)
```

Run both scripts after building the project and automatically generate a new RSS feed and sitemap.

```diff:package.json
"scripts": {
+    "sitemap": "node scripts/sitemap.mjs",
+    "rss": "node scripts/rss.mjs",
+    "postbuild": "yarn sitemap && yarn rss",
  },
```

## Final Thoughts

Building Static sites with Next.js becomes so effortless with MDX and Contentlayer.

MDX combines with remark and rehype ecosystem enriches the possibility of building consistent pages with Markdown.
Contentlayer makes data and content in MDX files available to consume in Next.js projects.

If you're exploring ways to build your own static sites, checkout the libraries mentioned earlier.
It not only reduces the time to market, but also is a lot of fun to build!🦄
