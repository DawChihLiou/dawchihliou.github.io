## TL;DR

---

One-on-one (1:1) meetings can easily become a missed opportunity in many ways. If you're an engineer, you might miss out on a regular guidance to your career development. If you're an engineering manager, you might miss out on an opportunity to sustain your team's camaraderie.

We'll be discussing 1 on 1 meetings in perspective of Engineering managers and Engineers.

## For Engineering Managers

### Keep It A Safe Environment

Making the engineers feel safe is the foundation of a good 1:1. It's important to establish three things early on:

- Everything you discuss during 1:1s stays private.
- This meeting is for them. They're the designers of the meeting.
- As a manager, you'll follow through.

The goal is to create a space where the engineers can express freely about their thoughts, emotions, and aspirations. You're here to support them.

### Listen Actively

### Sponsorship

### Encourage The Awkward

## For Engineers

### Your Manager's Expectations

- It's a safe environment where you can express yourself and it stays confidential.
- She's here to listen to your thoughts, emotions, and aspirations.
- She's committed to keep the 1 on 1 regular and to try not to cancel the meeting.
- She's expected to follow through the action items from the meeting.
- She's expected to provide feedback and situational coaching.

### It's Your Meeting

You are the driver of the meeting.

### Embrace The Awkward

### Share Agenda and Meeting Notes

### Career Development

## Final Thoughts
