## TL;DR

---

One-on-one (1:1) meetings have always been my favorite meetings! I've been very lucky to have great team leads and mentors that took my development seriously. I've learned so much from them and their insights helped me tremendously to grow from a self-taught Frontend Developer into a Principal Software Engineer.

As I got more experienced, I started hosting 1:1s for engineers. The feeling seeing the people you care about thriving in their roles is amazing.

Having the experience sitting on both sides of the table, I've seen some common mistakes by engineers and managers to take the full advantage of 1:1 meetings. So I want to share with you some of the biggest mistakes from the perspective of both Engineering managers and Engineers.

## For Engineers

### You didn't Make It Awkward Enough

1:1 is your perfect opportunity to communicate with your manager or mentors about the things that matter to you. It's an uninterrupted 30 minutes to an hour private conversation with someone that is there for you and you only. So take advantage of that and think about what's important to you at this stage of your career. Structure your agenda accordingly and go through the talking points candidly with your manager or mentors regardless of how awkward it might be.

The awkward conversations could be about:

- Your lack of motivation because of your salary expectations
- Your feelings about the direction of the team
- Your conflict with other team members
- Your frustration with your short-term and long-term career goals in the company
- Your expectations and feedback for your manager or mentors

Some of them might be uncomfortable to talk about in front of your manager or mentors but you have to remember that **this is your meeting**. By communicating what's important to you gives your manager or mentors a window to learn more about you and understand your needs. They have the tools to address your concerns and give your the support your career progression.

### You Made Agenda and Took Notes. Now What?

Share them.

You did great to make sure you have an agenda every time and take notes during your meetings. They are not only valuable data that you can keep track on your progress, but also a great reference for your managers and mentors. Share the agenda and notes and invite them to edit. It's a great way to make sure both parties are aligned with the talking points and action items.

I like to structure my agenda and notes in a shared document in the following format:

<div style={{'overflowX': 'auto'}}>
| Date       | Agenda                                                    | Notes                                                                 | Action Items                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mm.dd.yyyy | <ul><li>Talking Point A</li><li>Talking Point B</li></ul> | <ul><li>Notes for A</li><li>Notes for A</li><li>Notes for B</li></ul> | <ul><li>Action for @me</li><li>Action for @manager</li></ul> |
| mm.dd.yyyy | <ul><li>Talking Point A</li><li>Talking Point B</li></ul> | <ul><li>Notes for A</li><li>Notes for A</li><li>Notes for B</li></ul> | <ul><li>Action for @me</li><li>Action for @manager</li></ul> |

</div>
There are several benefits:

- Everything is in one shared document so it's convenient for you and your manager to contribute to it.
-

## For Engineering Managers

As an engineering manager,

### Keep It A Safe Environment

Making the engineers feel safe is the foundation of a good 1:1. It's important to establish three things early on:

- Everything you discuss during 1:1s stays private.
- This meeting is for them. They're the designers of the meeting.
- Make sure to follow through.

The goal is to create a space where the engineers can express freely about their thoughts, emotions, and aspirations. You're here to support them and provide timely guidance.

### Listen Actively

### Sponsorship
