## TL;DR

---

If you want to learn how to deploy like [Vercel][3] or [Netlify][4] with [Google Cloud][8], this is the right place for you.

Vercel and Netlify both offer seamless transition from development to shipping your features and they make [continuous delivery][9] accessible out of the box. Today we'll be looking into how to design and re-create the live deployment and [Deploy Preview][3] with [Cloud Run][10] and [GitHub Actions][11].

Let's go.

## The Modern Workflow Design

If you are familiar with [Vercel][5] or [Netlify][6], you'll notice the [trunk-based development][12] principle by default. Your code changes directly go **live** when pushing your commits or merging a pull request to the _main_ branch. Whenever you work on a pull request, both platforms create **Deploy Previews** so that you can collect feedback from your reviewers and stakeholders during development. This type of workflow enables us to collaborate early, mitigate errors, and ship fast.

To design the workflow, we can break it down to two paths:

- Production workflow: triggered by _push_ events in the _main_ branch.
- Preview workflow: triggered by _push_ and _pull_request_ events in all branches except _main_.

Let's look into the _prod workflow_ first.

## Production Workflow

<img
  src="/optimized/articles/deploy-with-cloud-run/workflows-main.webp"
  alt="production workflow overview"
  width="100%"
  className="rounded centered"
  loading="lazy"
/>

The production workflow does only one thing: live deployment. When a pull request merges into _main_, it triggers the workflow to deploy your production build to [Cloud Run][10].

The workflow looks like this:

Set up Google Cloud

- Authenticate to Google Cloud
- Setup Google [Cloud SDK][14]
- Authorize to push docker containers to [Artifact Registry][13]

Push Docker Image to Artifact Registry

- Generate image tag
- Build docker container
- push docker container to registry

Deploy

- Deploy to Cloud Run

### Set up Google Cloud

> If you don't have a project on Google Cloud yet, follow [this guide][19] to create one. I'll name my project _awesome-project_.

To authenticate the workflow to access Google Cloud, we can use the [_auth_][1] GitHub Action to create an access token:

```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ID: 'awesome-project'
  SERVICE: 'homepage'
  REGION: 'us-west1' # ☘️Low CO2
  REGISTRY: '[YOUR_REGISTRY_ID]'
  IMAGE_NAME: 'live'
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: '[YOUR_WORKLOAD_PROVIDER_ID]'
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT: '[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0.4.0'
        id: 'auth'
        with:
          token_format: 'access_token'
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ env.WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ env.SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
```

Here we are authenticating via [Workload Identity Federation][15]. To make it work, we'll need

- [a service account][16]
- [a workload identity provider][17]
- [to grand IAM roles to the Workload Identity Provider][2].

Congratulations, you've done it! It's the most difficult part of the workflow.

Now we can set up Cloud SDK and authorize the workflow to be able to push Docker containers to Artifact Registry:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Set up Cloud SDK
    uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0

  - name: Authorize Docker push
    run: gcloud auth configure-docker ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
```

You can follow [this guide][18] to set up Artifact Registry for storing Docker containers.

### Push Docker Image to Artifact Registry

We are now able to push containers so let's dockerize your project and tag your image:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Generate Image Tag
    id: image-tag
    run: |
      image_tag="$REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE/$IMAGE_NAME:${GITHUB_SHA::8}"
      echo "tag=$image_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  - name: Build Docker Container
    run: |
      docker build -t ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

  - name: Push Docker Container
    run: |
      docker push ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}
```

### Deploy

Now you are ready to deploy to cloud run using the docker container:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
    run: |
      gcloud run deploy ${{ env.SERVICE }} \
        --platform "managed"
        --region ${{ env.REGION }} \
        --image ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}
```

Cloud Run will assign 100% of the traffic to this deployment by default so all visitors will be directed to this revision.

In the Cloud Console, you'll find a URL to your Cloud Run deployment. It looks like this: _https://homepage-12345abcde-ez.a.run.app_. We'll need it later for our preview workflow.

### The Complete GitHub Actions Production Workflow:

```yaml:prod-ci.yaml
name: Production Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  PROJECT_ID: 'awesome-project'
  SERVICE: 'homepage'
  REGION: 'us-west1' # ☘️Low CO2
  REGISTRY: '[YOUR_REGISTRY_ID]'
  IMAGE_NAME: 'live'
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: '[YOUR_WORKLOAD_PROVIDER_ID]'
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT: '[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0.4.0'
        id: 'auth'
        with:
          token_format: 'access_token'
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ env.WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ env.SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

      - name: Set up Cloud SDK
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0

      - name: Authorize Docker push
        run: gcloud auth configure-docker ${{ env.REGISTRY }}

      - name: Generate Image Tag
        id: image-tag
        run: |
          image_tag="$REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE/$IMAGE_NAME:${GITHUB_SHA::8}"
          echo "tag=$image_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Build Docker Container
        run: |
          docker build -t ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

      - name: Push Docker Container
        run: |
          docker push ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

      - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
        run: |
          gcloud run deploy ${{ env.SERVICE }} \
            --platform "managed"
            --region ${{ env.REGION }} \
            --image ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}
```

## Preview Workflow

<img
  src="/optimized/articles/deploy-with-cloud-run/workflows-branch.webp"
  alt="preview workflow overview"
  width="100%"
  className="rounded centered"
  loading="lazy"
/>

The preview workflow is similar to production with a few modifications:

Set up Google Cloud

- Authenticate to Google Cloud
- Setup Google [Cloud SDK][14]
- Authorize to push docker containers to [Artifact Registry][13]

Push Docker Image to Artifact Registry

- **Get Task Id from Reference**
- Generate image tag
- Build docker container
- push docker container to registry

Deploy

- **Deploy revision with tag**
- **Comment preview URL in the pull request**

Let's take a look at the differences.

### Push Docker Image to Artifact Registry

The first difference is tagging the Docker image. In the production workflow, we use a constant `$IMAGE_NAME` in environment variables to tag the production image. However, for previews, we want to use an identifier that represents the pull request. We are using the first 8 characters of the branch name as the identifier:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Get Task Id from Reference
  id: task
  run: |
    name="${{ github.ref_name }}"
    lowercase="${name,,}"
    echo "id=${lowercase:0:8}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

As an example I'll name the branch _TASK-123-awesome-workflow_. The _task_ step will extract the task ID _task-123_ from the branch name.

> If you are curious about the shell script syntax, check out [Shell Parameter Expansion][7].

The identifier is set to be in lowercase because we'll use it for tagging the Cloud Run revision later. The naming convention of [Cloud Run tags][20] is as follows:

- it allows lowercase characters
- it allows numbers
- it allows "-"
- it has a maximum length limit of 63 characters

Next we can use the task id to tag the image, build a container, and push to the registry:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Generate Image Tag
    id: image-tag
    run: |
      image_tag="$REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE/${{ steps.task.outputs.id }}:${GITHUB_SHA::8}"
      echo "tag=$image_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  - name: Build Docker Container
    run: |
      docker build -t ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

  - name: Push Docker Container
    run: |
      docker push ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}
```

### Deploy

Now we are ready to deploy the preview. The deployment is similar to live deployment with two differences:

- Unlike live deployment, we want to assign 0% of the traffic to the preview revision.
- We want to give the deployment a different URL other than the live URL.

We can use _--tag_ and _--no-traffic_ parameters to achieve them:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy Revision with Tag
      run: |
        gcloud run deploy ${{ env.SERVICE }} \
          --platform "managed" \
          --region ${{ env.REGION }} \
          --image ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }} \
          --tag pr-${{ steps.task.outputs.id }} \
          --no-traffic
```

After running the step successfully, you'll get the preview URL like this: _https://pr-task-123---homepage-12345abcde-ez.a.run.app_.

Finally, we can post a comment about the preview URL on the pull request:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Comment Preview URL in PR
    uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      message: |
        🍿 Successfully deployed preview revision at https://pr-${{ steps.jira.outputs.id }}---homepage-12345abcde-ez.a.run.app
      allow-repeats: false
```

### The Complete GitHub Actions Preview Workflow

```yaml:preview.yaml
name: Preview Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ['Dev CI']
    types: [completed]

env:
  PROJECT_ID: 'awesome-project'
  SERVICE: 'homepage'
  REGION: 'us-west1'
  REGISTRY: '[YOUR_REGISTRY_ID]'
  WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: '[YOUR_WORKLOAD_PROVIDER_ID]'
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT: '[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]'

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    permissions:
      pull-requests: 'write'

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v0.4.0'
        id: 'auth'
        with:
          token_format: 'access_token'
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ env.WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ env.SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

      - name: Set up Cloud SDK
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0

      - name: Authorize Docker push
        run: gcloud auth configure-docker ${{ env.REGISTRY }}

      # Get task id in lowercase from branch name for docker image naming convention
      # More detail on base parameter expansion: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html
      - name: Get Task Id from Reference
        id: task
        run: |
          name="${{ github.ref_name }}"
          lowercase="${name,,}"
          echo "id=${lowercase:0:8}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Generate Image Tag
        id: image-tag
        run: |
          image_tag="$REGISTRY/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE/${{ steps.task.outputs.id }}:${GITHUB_SHA::8}"
          echo "tag=$image_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Build Docker Container
        run: |
          docker build -t ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

      - name: Push Docker Container
        run: |
          docker push ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}

      - name: Deploy Revision with Tag
        run: |
          gcloud run deploy ${{ env.SERVICE }} \
            --platform "managed" \
            --region ${{ env.REGION }} \
            --image ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }} \
            --tag pr-${{ steps.jira.outputs.id }} \
            --no-traffic

      - name: Comment Preview URL in PR
        uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          message: |
            🍿 Successfully deployed preview revision at https://pr-${{ steps.jira.outputs.id }}---homepage-12345abcde-ez.a.run.app
          allow-repeats: false
```

## Final Thoughts

We've just re-created the modern workflow from Vercel and Netlify! There are a few improvements to make the workflow more robust:

- use a short hash as the identifier to tag preview image and Cloud Run revision
- replace the hard coded live URL with a step output in the preview comment step
- add a workflow that cleans up the unused Cloud Run revisions and Docker containers
