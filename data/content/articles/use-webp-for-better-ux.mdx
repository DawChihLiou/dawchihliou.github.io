## TL;DR

- [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) is a modern image format that provides amazing [lossless and lossy compression](https://www.keycdn.com/support/lossy-vs-lossless).
- WebP makes images richer and smaller.
- WebP makes web faster.
- We don't have to convert our images to WebP ourselves. We have tools for that.
- [Not all browsers support WebP format](https://caniuse.com/?search=webp) so you'll need fallback images.
- Check out [source code](https://github.com/DawChihLiou/dawchihliou.github.io) on GitHub.

## What Is Wrong?

As I'm re-making [my portfolio](https://dawchihliou.github.io/), there is something nagging that bothers me.
I have a `128x128` portait photo displayed on the top of my portfolio that is `251.35KB`.
It's way too big for its size and takes too long to download and that has a direct impact on my Lighthouse report.

It might not seem like a big deal. Afterall, a lot of people are enjoying high-speed WIFI and modern browsers.
But I want my portfolio to be [**mobile-first**](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/).
It's important to me that my content can reach to audience that are using cellular data and mobile devices with ease.

## next-gen Image Format

There are many ways to tackle image delivery and optimization such as using services like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
What I'm looking for is a way to serve self-hosted static assets to reduce complexity of the project and a process that would work with release workflow.

> So I want to generate optimized images in [next-gen format](https://web.dev/uses-webp-images/) during build time.

Amond all the format options, [WebP is the most widely supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=webp). So let's see how to make it work!

## Integrate WebP Image in Project

---

You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/DawChihLiou/dawchihliou.github.io).
There are code snippets in this article and you could always reference them in the source code if you're interested.

---

We can first [follow the instruction](https://web.dev/codelab-serve-images-webp/) to generate WebP images with command line.

```bash
cwebp -q 75 raw/portrait.png -o optimized/portrait.webp
```

Let's compare the file size.

- Raw PNG image: `251.35KB`
- Generated WebP image: `5.3KB`

That's a `97.89%` reduction right off the bat. Let's have a look at the image quality.

<img
  src="/optimized/webp-comparison.png"
  alt="PNG and WebP comparison"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

If we zoom in a little, we can actually see the difference between the two compression algorithms.
The WebP format overall quality is very desirable, even with the quality of `75` (`0` is the worst, `100` is the best).

Now we can use the generated image in the code.

```jsx
// components/Intro

<img src="optimized/portrait.webp" alt="Daw-Chih's portait" />
```

We can have a look at the download time from Network.

<img
  src="/optimized/network.png"
  alt="WebP in Network"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

It takes about 1 millisecond to download the image. We just proved how effective WebP can be for our web performance.

## Do We Have to Use The Command?

It's not very convenient to convert images with the command.
What we are looking for is to host all the images in `/raw` directory and output WebP images in `/optimized` directory.
Luckly I found something cool. [`imagemin`](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) is a npm library that minifies images.
It offers a handy [WebP imagemin plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-webp) and all we need to do is to create a JavaScript file,

```ts
// lib/webp.js

const imagemin = require('imagemin')
const imageminWebp = require('imagemin-webp')

/**
 * generate webp images inside of destination directory
 */
imagemin(['raw/*.{jpg,png}'], {
  destination: 'optimized',
  plugins: [imageminWebp({ quality: 75 })],
})
```

and run

```bash
node lib/webp.js
```

to take all the raw images and generate WebP images in `/optimized`.

## Not All Browsers Support WebP Format

So we need fallback images to support wider range of browsers. Let's first optimize our raw images with their original formats.
There are two `imagemin plugins` we can use:

- [`imagemin-pngquant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-pngquant): for PNG images
- [`imagemin-jpegtran`](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin-jpegtran): for JPEG images

```ts
// lib/webp.js

const imageminJpegtran = require('imagemin-jpegtran')
const imageminPngquant = require('imagemin-pngquant')

/**
 * generate optimized fallback images
 */
imagemin(['raw/*.{jpg,png}'], {
  destination: 'optimized',
  plugins: [
    imageminJpegtran(),
    imageminPngquant({
      quality: [0.6, 0.8],
    }),
  ],
})
```

Now we are ready to add fallback images.

```jsx
// components/Intro

<picture>
  <source srcSet="optimized/portrait.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcSet="optimized/portrait.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="optimized/portrait.png" alt="Daw-Chih's portait" />
</picture>
```

At this point, we can really compare all image qualities.

##### PNG (left) and optimized PNG (right) comparison

<img
  src="/optimized/png-comparison.png"
  alt="PNG and optimized PNG comparison"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

##### PNG (left) and WebP (right) comparison

<img
  src="/optimized/webp-comparison.png"
  alt="PNG and WebP comparison"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

If you are looking for optimizing SVG files, you can achieve it with [`imagemin-svgo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-svgo).

```ts
// lib/webp.js

const imageminSvgo = require('imagemin-svgo')

/**
 * generate optimized svg files
 */
imagemin(['public/raw/*.svg'], {
  destination: 'optimized',
  plugins: [imageminSvgo({ removeViewBox: false })],
})
```

## We Are Ready to Integrate with Workflow Automation

In our `package.json`, add the following scripts.

```ts
"scripts": {
  "image": "node lib/webp.js",
  "prepare": "yarn image",
}
```

The `prepare` script will execute after installation. This will allow us to build our image assets in the workflows of our choice.

For example, to deploy my portfolio with GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages as a static site, a workflow looks like this.

```yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies üê•
        run: yarn install

      - name: Export static assets üì¶
        run: yarn build && yarn export

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.6.2
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages
          FOLDER: out # contains all static assets
```

In the "Install dependencies" step, the job installs the dependencies, and then generate the optimized images.
The images will be deployed alongside with the other assets in `/out` directory.

## To Sum up

WebP is designed for web. The image quality and size is very desirable especially for mobile users.
With the right tooling, generating WebP image can work seemlessly with automation.
As long as we make sure that the fallback images are in place, our audience can benefit tremendously from the boost of speed and better enjoy our content.

##### Lighthouse report with optimized WebP images

<img
  src="/optimized/lighthouse-report.png"
  alt="Lighthouse report"
  width="100%"
  loading="lazy"
/>

If you're wondering how to test Redux Observable, I wrote an ariticle ["Writing Better Marble Tests for Redux Observable and TypeScript"](https://itnext.io/better-marble-test-70c7676a1e2) just for you.
It's a comprehensive guide to walk you through the thought process.
