It's all about what I'm up to **now**.

👨‍💻 A Free/libre open source software developer.

🌏 I'm trying out eating seasonal and local produce.

🏋️‍♂️ I'm lifting weight again! Making baby steps.

✏️ I'm learning to be a good technical writer.

🌱 I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's been fun!
